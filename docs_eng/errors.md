API extensively uses informing through HTTP response codes. The application must
process them correctly.

When an error occurs, the response body, besides the response code, will have an
additional information that helps the developer to learn the cause of the error.

All errors are displayed in the format:

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "type": "...",
            "value": "..."
        }
    ]
}
```

Several errors can be returned at the same time. The `type` key is present in
each `errors` array object and contains a text identifier of the error class.
The `value` key is optional and provides more detail on the error.

> Apart from the `errors` described above, API can optionally return other keys
> left for backward compatibility. **It is not recommended to use them.**


<a name="general-errors"></a>
## General errors

If the requested resource can't be found, the
`404 Not Found` response will be returned and the `errors` array will have
the object:

```json
{
    "type": "not_found"
}
```

If there is an error in request parameters (e.g.
`GET https://api.hh.ru/vacancies/?employer_id=foo`) the
`400 Bad Request` response will be returned, and the error array will have
the object:

```json
{
    "type": "bad_argument",
    "value": "employer_id"
}
```

<a name="system-errors"></a>
## System error

If the service can't process the request at the moment, but understood it
correctly, the `503 Service Unavailable` response will be returned and `type`
will contain `service_unavailable`.

In case of unforeseen situation, API will return 500.

In rare cases errors with 5** codes can be returned with the body that doesn't
contain the valid json. In such a case the application should rely only on the
response code.


## General request errors

<a name="user-agent"></a>
### Incorrect User-Agent

More detail on the [User-Agent title](general.md#request-requirements).

| HTTP code | type             | value       | description                         |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|

<a name="oauth"></a>
### Authorization use errors

In case you [make an authorized request](authorization.md#check-access_token) in
api and your authorization is not valid for any reason, an error with `type`
`oauth`, and, possibly, with one of the listed `values`, will be returned.

| HTTP code | type  | value                   | description  |
|-----------|-------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 403       | oauth | bad_authorization      | authorization token doesn't exist or is not valid |
| 403       | oauth | token_expired          | access_token validity period has expired, it is necessary to [refresh the access_token](https://api.hh.ru/openapi/en/redoc#tag/Employer-authorization/operation/authorize)  |
| 403       | oauth | token_revoked          | the token is revoked by the user, the application should [request a new authorization](authorization.md) |
| 403       | oauth | application_not_found  | your application has been deleted

<a name="employer_payable_methods"></a>
## Errors when accessing a paid method

In case you request a [paid method](/docs_eng/payable/employer_payable_methods.md) without buying access, the following error will be generated:

HTTP code | type | value | description
----------|------|-------|-----------
403 | api_access_payment | action_must_be_payed | You have requested a paid method without buying access

<a name="service-errors"></a>
## Errors of separate resources

If the service can return more detailed information on the
error, it will be given in the response body. In this case the response code
will likely be 400, 403, 409, 429, but other codes are also possible.

At the least, the application should process HTTP response statuses correctly.
To facilitate the work with the application, it is recommended to also process
the response type that has come. The tables listed below contain an incomplete
error list; it can be extended.

fallback_url | string or null | Address of the webpage where a similar operation can be completed (more often than not, the page itself is protected with a captcha)
captcha_url | string or null | Address of the webpage where to pass the captcha. Once the captcha is passed successfully, a similar request in API should also be completed successfully. The app is to add to `captcha_url` the required parameter `backurl`, to which the redirect will go after the captcha is passed. The `backurl` must always contain a schema, e.g., `https://`, or the app schema

One or the other of the `fallback_url` or `captcha_url` parameters may be absent, but both cannot be absent at the same time.

* `403 Forbidden` — captcha required (this will never come, unless the token has not been transmitted)
