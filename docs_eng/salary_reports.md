#### Parameters of indirect salary assessment

The `resulting_parameters.indirect_calculation` field is present in the response only when data is requested
for one region and contains parameters of indirect salary assessment.

In the above example, instead of `"indirect_calculation": null`, there may be the following:

```json
{
    "indirect_employee_levels": [
        {
            "id": "senior_specialist",
            "name": "Ведущий специалист"
        }
    ],
    "indirect_areas":[
        {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "Москва"
        }
    ],
    "indirect_regional_ratio": 0.4375
}
```

Name | Type | Description
----|-----|---------
indirect_calculation.indirect_areas | array or null | Regions used for indirect calculation
indirect_calculation.indirect_employee_levels | array or null | Levels of specialists included in the sample in the region used for indirect calculation
indirect_calculation.indirect_regional_ratio | number | Regional factor used to obtain indirect salary assessment

The response given above means that:
* the request for the "Southern Federal District" (`resulting_parameters.areas`) region
* gave no data on salaries for the requested "Specialist" (`resulting_parameters.employee_levels`) level
* however the indirect calculation
    * for the "Leading Specialist" (`resulting_parameters.indirect_calculation.indirect_employee_levels`) level
    * in the "Moscow" (`resulting_parameters.indirect_calculation.indirect_areas`) region was performed.
    * coefficient was 0.4375 (`resulting_parameters.indirect_calculation.indirect_regional_ratio`)
