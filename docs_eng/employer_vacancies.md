## Conditions for filling out fields when publishing and adding vacancies

`GET /vacancy_conditions`

Each end field is described by a rules object. If a field consists of
an object with several fields, these fields are described in `fields`.

Only employers have access to conditions for vacancy fields, otherwise
the system will return a response code `403 Forbidden`.

For all fields and their parts it is indicated if they are mandatory (`required`).

### Rules

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | --------
required | boolean | Is the vacancy field or object field necessary?
min_length | numeric | Minimum length for text fields.
max_length | numeric | Maximum length for text fields.
min_count | numeric | Minimum number of objects for fields with lists.
max_count | numeric or `null` | Maximum number of objects for fields with lists. `null` if the number is not limited.

### Errors

<a name="edit"></a>
## Editing vacancies

`PUT /vacancies/{vacancy_id}`

* `ignore_duplicates=true` - ignore [duplicates](#edit-ignore-duplicates) after editing the vacancy.

Editing is similar to publishing a vacancy but with an option to send individual fields in an object for partial editing.
Compound fields (such as `salary`, `contacts`, `specializations`) can be edited only as a whole; 
the entire object will be sent. For example, to edit salary currency, you will also have to change the salary value;
to change the specialisation you will have to send a full list.

### Response

A successful response contains a code `204 No Content`.

### Errors

* `404 Not Found` – vacancy for editing not found.
* `403 Forbidden` – current user cannot edit vacancies.
* `400 Bad Request` – error found in a field when editing the vacancy.
* <a name="edit-ignore-duplicates"></a> `403 Forbidden` –
  the vacancy cannot be edited, because editing makes the vacancy
    similar to another vacancy from the same employer. If you are sure that
    a duplicate is necessary, you can add
  `PUT /vacancies/{vacancy_id}?ignore_duplicates=true`.

In addition to the HTTP code, the server can return a description of the [error reason](errors.md#vacancies-create-n-edit).


<a name="edit_more"></a>
### Editing billing type or vacancy manager

You can only improve the vacancy type.

Editing the billing type of a vacancy or passing the vacancy to another
manager in the company is similar to editing `PUT /vacancies/{vacancy_id}`. 
The only peculiarity is that the following fields (`billing_type` and `manager`) 
must be sent separately from the remaining fields of the vacancy.

```
PUT /vacancies/{vacancy_id}
```

```json
{
    "billing_type": {
        "id": "premium"
    }
}
```

and

```
PUT /vacancies/{vacancy_id}
```

```json
{
    "manager": {
        "id": "1337"
    }
}
```

### Response

A successful response contains a code `204 No Content` and is body-less.

### Errors

* `404 Not Found` – vacancy for editing not found.
* `403 Forbidden` – current user cannot edit vacancies.
* `403 Forbidden` – `billing_type` and `manager` are passed along with others.

In addition to the HTTP code, the server can return a description of the [error reason](errors.md#vacancies-create-n-edit).

Each element from `items` has the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
date | string | Date in format `YYYY-MM-DD`
responses | number or null | Number of applications, `null` if the date is in the future or there is no data for this date
views | number or null | Number of views, `null` if the date is in the future or there is no data for this date

The system returns a window of the last 5 days of the publication life:

* if the vacancy was created after the start of the window, the vacancy publication date will go first;
* if the vacancy is archived or deleted, the archiving date will go last.

### Errors

* `403 Forbidden` – current user is not an employer
* `404 Not Found` – vacancy with the passed ID does not exist
