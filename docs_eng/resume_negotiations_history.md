# History of responses/invitations for a resume

> <img src="http://hhru.github.io/api/badges/emp_paid.png" alt="employer with paid access" /> : Methods require [paid access for the employer](/docs_eng/payable/employer_payable_methods.md)

Only employers can get the history of responses/invitations. The list will contain the last actions
with the resumes specified: no more than 30 jobs of this employer, and no more than 10 status changes in responses/invitations
for each of these jobs.


### Request

You do not need to construct the URL of the request manually, you need to get it
from the [`negotiations_history` field in the resume](resumes.md#negotiations-history-field).

`GET /resumes/{resume_id}/negotiations_history`,

where `resume_id` – resume ID.

<a name="response"></a>
### Response

Successful server response is returned with `200 OK` code and contains:
