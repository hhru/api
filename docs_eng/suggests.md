# Suggestions

When filling in the experience and education fields, it is recommended to use
the tips services (autocomplete, autosuggest).

All suggestions work in the same way: they receive text that is a part of the
suggested meaning, and return a list of relevant elements. The text being
searched must contain at least two symbols. In case too short a text is given,
`400 Bad Request` will be returned with the error description in the
response body:


```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "bad_argument",
      "value": "text"
    }
  ]
}
```

Some tips accept the required element `locale` – the tip language. Supported
languages: `RU`, `EN`, `UA`, `AZ`, `KZ`. In case the tip requires a language,
but it was not included in the request, `RU` language will be used. If an
unsupported language is specified, the `400 Bad Request` error will be
returned with detailed error description in the response body:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "bad_argument",
      "value": "locale"
    }
  ]
}
```

send a GET request to `/suggests/educational_institutions` with the following
