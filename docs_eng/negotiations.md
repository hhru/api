# Negotiations (responses/invitations) for applicants

_Negotiations documentation for the employer is available in the [separate article](employer_negotiations.md)._

Using the website, applicants choose vacancies. In order to contact an employer
for vacancy details, an applicant can respond to the chosen vacancy. An
employer, on his part, can offer an applicant to consider a vacancy (invitation).

For these purposes, there are special entities â€“ responses and invitations.
They can include a vacancy, CV and negotiations with employer; at any given time
such entities have one of the states. Transition between the states is
accompanied by appearance of messages with optional text descriptions and other
fields. Messages with `null` status do not transit the whole respond to a new
state.
