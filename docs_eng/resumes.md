## View a CV

> <img src="http://hhru.github.io/api/badges/emp_paid.png" alt="employer with paid access" /> : Methods require [paid access for the employer](employer_payable_methods.md)

```
GET /resumes/{resume_id}
``` 

returns an indicated CV. If the CV visibility is set
to "visible to entire Internet" or "by direct link" (`everyone` and `direct`
respectively), it is possible to request the CV without being authorized.

An authorized publisher receives more detailed information, including the type of
visibility, comments of moderators, and status.

As for the employer, if it is not possible to view the full information on the resume given the current
authorization, some fields will contain `null`, and the `can_view_full_info` field will be `false`.

Once this URL has been requested, if the employer has an response/invitation for this resume, 
the response will be registered as viewed.

### Resume-related paid services for the employer

An employer may be offered a list of paid resume-related services.

For example, if the full resume information is not available, the employer will receive
an offer to purchase a recommended service that allows such access.

The list of services is displayed in the `paid_services` list. The following fields are available for each service:

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
id | string | service ID
name | string | service name
price_list.alternate_url | string | link to the site where the full price for the service is available
quick_purchase | object, null | a quick service purchase, if available
quick_purchase.alternate_url | string | link to the site where you will be asked to buy a service
quick_purchase.name | string | name of the action for the service order
quick_purchase.price | nubmer | price of service
quick_purchase.currency | object | currency of service


<a name="owner-field"></a>
#### Information on the resume owner

The `owner` field contains the following information on the resume owner:

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
id | string | Resume owner ID
comments | object | [comments for the resume owner](applicant_comments.md#list)
comments.url | string | The URL to perform a GET request to obtain the list of comments
comments.counters | object | information on the number of comments
comments.counters.total | number | total number of comments

<a name="negotiations-history-field"></a>
#### Brief history of responses/invitations for a resume

The `negotiations_history.url` field is always available and contains the URL to perform a GET request to obtain the
[detailed history of responses/invitations for a resume](resume_negotiations_history.md).

The `negotiations_history.vacancies` is available only when
the following additional parameter was passed when executing the [request for resume](resumes.md#item):
`with_negotiations_history`. In this case, the GET request should look like this:

`GET /resumes/{resume_id}?with_negotiations_history=true`

The format of the `negotiations_history.vacancies` field is described on the
[detailed history of responses/invitations for a resume](resume_negotiations_history.md#response) page, and the only difference is that
in this case, the list will be limited to 3 jobs of this employer and the latest status change
for the response/invitation for each of these jobs.

<a name="create_edit"></a>
## Creating and editing a resume

`POST /resumes` — adding a resume

`PUT /resumes/{resume_id}` — editing an existing resume. JSON of the same format as sent for a GET request
                             is used as a request body. In this case, only id of transferred data is used
                             for the fields with the directory data from the transferred JSON structure. 
                             For example, in a resume, in the languages field, Russian is indicated as the native language:

```json
{
    "language": [
        {
            "id": "rus",
            "name": "Russian",
            "level": {
                "id": "native",
                "name": "native"
            }
        }
     ]
   }
```

To add English with "read professional
literature" level send the following JSON:

```json
{
    "language": [
        {
            "id": "rus",
            "name": "Russian",
            "level": {
                "id": "native",
                "name": "native"
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "eng",
            "level": {
                "id": "can_read"
            }
        }
    ]
  }
```

The first element is Russian, which we already have in languages, the second is
the new element, English, that we want to add. Fields `language.name` and
`language.level.name` in this case are not in the way but also do not carry useful information.

Sending data replaces existing data for the selected parameter.
Each parameter can be sent separately.

        "max_date": "1999-10-21"
    },
    //...
}
```

Each end field is described by a rules object. If the field in a resume consists of
an object with several fields, these fields are described in `fields`.

For all fields and their parts it is indicated if they are mandatory (`required`).
Sometimes a field represented by an object with fields is not mandatory on its own,
but if at least one field of the object is filled out,
its other fields must be filled out, too. Example: the desired salary (`salary`) can be either not indicated
or indicated but compulsorily with currency.

Rules
-------

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
required | boolean | The resume field of the object field is mandatory.
min_length | number | Minimum length for text fields.
max_length | number | Maximum length for text fields.
not_in | list | A list of invalid values
min_count | number | Minimum number of objects, for fields with lists.

## Conditions to fill in the fields of a new resume

`GET /resume_conditions` returns a list of requirements for the fields in the new resume.
If the authorized user is not an applicant, the system will return the
`403 Forbidden` response code, otherwise it will be `200 OK`.


<a name="conditions-contacts"></a>
## Conditions for contacts in a resume
When filling out contacts in a resume, take the following into account:

 * The resume must contain an email address (and only one).

 * The resume must contain a phone number, and there can be only one number for each type.
   
 * Comments are only available for phone numbers, a comment for an email will not be saved.

 * In the `email` contact, the value is email, for phone it is the object.


Example message for changing contacts in the resume:

```json
{
    "contact": [
        {
            "type": {
                "id": "email"
            },
            "value": "box@test.ru"
        },
        {
            "type": {
                "id": "cell"
            },
            "value": {
                "country": "7",
                "city": "123",
                "number": "4567890",
                "preferred": true
            }
        },
        {
            "type": {
                "id": "home"
            },
            "value": {
                "formatted": "7(499)9078456"
            },
            "comment": "On phone before 9 PM"
        }
    ]
}
```

You must provide either the whole phone number in the `formatted` field or all three parts of the phone number separately in 
the fields `country`, `city` and `number`. If both options are available, the system uses data from the separate fields.
The `formatted` field may contain additional symbols: spaces, brackets, and hyphens.
The separate fields may only contain numbers.


<a name="conditions-other"></a>
## Additional rules for resume fields

There are other rules for filling out a resume outside of the
above-described format:

 * It is not allowed to create several resumes with the same title.

 * Specialisation must be from the same area of profession.

 * The place of residence must be obtained from the `/areas` directory and the selected city cannot
      contain daughter objects, for example, the user cannot indicate
      "Russia" as the place of residence.

 * The nearest metro station must be located in the place of residence.

 * For specialisations from the area *Start of career, students* (id=15) it is not necessary to specify work experience. 
 For other areas of profession these fields must contain at least one entry.

 * Some of the fields of the resume are read-only and cannot be changed with POST/PUT at /resumes.

<a name="download-links"></a>
## Resume download links

At the moment, resumes can be downloaded in the following formats: PDF and RTF.
Applicants can download their resumes. 
An employer can only download an applicant's resume if the company has a response/invitation to that resume as part of an active job vacancy. 
The name of the downloaded file may contain the applicant's name or desired position.

### Request

To download a resume, you need to use the URL obtained from the API response, while passing [standard API headers](general.md#request-requirements).

```
GET https://....(a link obtained in the full or shortened resume from the API)
```

### Response

A successful response comes with a code and contains the requested file in its body.

### Errors

* `404 Not Found` - If the resume does not exist or is not available to the user.
* `429 Too Many Requests` - If the daily limit of resume views is exceeded (when the user is authorized as an employer).

In addition to the HTTP code, the server can return a description of the [error cause](errors.md#resumes).


<a name="status"></a>
## CV status

The `status` key determines the current status of the resume and contains an entry from the
[resume_status](dictionaries.md) directory. After creating a new resume, it
gets the `not_published` status. No one can see a resume with this status,
the user begins to fill in and save the resume (empty mandatory fields
are present in the `progress.mandatory` list). 

After all mandatory fields are filled in, the `can_publish_or_update` flag 
will become `true`, and the resume will be available for
[publication](#publish). After publication, the resume gets the `published` status.
A resume with this status is searchable if permitted by the settings for
[resume visibility](#access_type).

After receiving the `published` status, the resume is available for moderators and
can be banned (the `blocked` status), if the fields are invalid or
contain insufficient information. Reasons for banning a resume can be found in
the [`moderation_note` key](#author-moderation-notes). A banned resume
is not searchable and cannot be used to respond to a job.

After editing, the resume can be sent to the moderator for secondary revision.
In this case, the resume status changes to `on_moderation` and from there it can
go to `blocked` again or to `published`, depending on the moderator's decision.

Once the resume is published (status changed to `published`) it cannot be changed back to
`not_published` but it can be hidden in the [resume visibility](#access_type) settings.

In `published` status, the resume can be used to [apply for jobs](negotiations.md) and it will appear on the
[list of suitable vacancies](suitable_resumes.md) if it has not been used yet to apply for this job.


<a name="access_type"></a>
## CV access type

Each resume has the `access` visibility setting that determines to whom the resume will be available
in the search results or using a direct link. The field's format in the resume:

```json
{
    "access": {
        "type": {
            "id": "clients",
            "name": "visible to all companies registered on HeadHunter"
        }
    }
}
```

After publication, the resume can be searched by all employers. Otherwise,
for example, when a job is found and you want to hide the resume in the search results, you should change
the resume visibility settings. The "access.type" key is responsible for this. Visibility type is a
[resume_access_type](dictionaries.md) directory entry.

 Code | Description
 --- | --------
 no_one | A resume of this type is not visible to anyone. However, it can be used to apply for a vacancy and the resume type will change to `whitelist`.
 whitelist | The resume is visible only to the specified companies. If you respond to a job of a company that is not listed, that company will be automatically included in the list. Please see [resume visibility lists](#visibility_lists).
 blacklist | РThe resume can be searched and viewed by all companies, except for ones specified. If you respond to a job of a company that is blacklisted, that company will be automatically excluded from the black list. Please see [resume visibility lists](#visibility_lists).
 clients | The resume is visible to all companies registered on hh.ru.
 everyone | The resume is visible to all users (everywhere on the Internet).
 direct |The resume is visible only with a direct link (link specified in the `alternate_url` key).


<a name="visibility_lists"></a>
### Resume visibility lists


Some types of visibility, such as `whitelist` and `blacklist`, imply the use of a list of employers
who can or cannot see the resume. Please see [managing resume visibility lists](resume_visibility.md).


<a name="get_access_types"></a>
### Retrieving a list of resume visibility types

Please see also [managing resume visibility lists](/docs/resume_visibility.md).


<a name="views"></a>
## Resume viewing history

`GET /resumes/{resume_id}/views` will return the viewing history for the resume. On the main website it can be found by 
clicking on the resume views number on the page with the list of the current user's resume
([https://hh.ru/applicant/resumes](https://hh.ru/applicant/resumes)).

Without authorisation or when requesting another user's resume, the system will return `403 Forbidden`.

The number of views (including new) is shown when requesting a specific
resume and list of resumes. The new views counter is reset to zero when requesting this resource.

```json
{
    "per_page": 20,
    "items": [
        {
            "created_at": "2014-02-05T19:05:58+0400",
            "viewed": true,
            "employer": {
                "logo_urls": {
                    "90": "https://hh.ru/employer/logo/1455",
                },

                "id": "1455"
            }
        }
    ],

        "title": "manager",
        "url": "https://api.hh.ru/resumes/502ff8b100018bddf30039ed1f63735f4dda66"
    }
}
```

where:

 Name | Type | Description
 --- | --- | --------
 found | number | Number of resume viewing records ( ≥ 0 )
 pages | number | Page number ( ≥ 0 )
 per_page | number | Number of elements per page ( > 0 )
 page | number | Current page number ( ≥ 0 )
 resume | object | [resume](#resume-nano)

The `items` element contains data about negotiations:

 Name | Type | Description
 --- | --- | ---
 created_at | string | Creation date, date when employer viewed the resume
 viewed | boolean | note of viewing the record (when requesting this resource, all requests are marked as viewed)
 employer | object | company info (see below)

`employer` object returns brief company info, a subset of the [company/employer](employers.md) object.

If an anonymous employer viewed the resume or the resume was viewed from
applications to an anonymous vacancy, `employer` may contain only the `name` key.

`logo_urls` — images of the company logo in different sizes. The client should take into account
              the probability that the resource will not be available at the specified link (`404 Not Found`).


<a name="similar"></a>
## Searching for jobs similar to a resume

The information is available only to the resume publisher.

### Request

`GET /resumes/{resume_id}/similar_vacancies`

where `resume_id` – ID of the resume.

It takes the same parameters as the [searching for jobs](vacancies.md#search-params)

When indicating paging parameters (`page`, `per_page`), a restriction takes
effect: the number of results returned can't exceed 2000. For instance, a
request `per_page=10&page=199` (displaying vacancies from 1991 to 2000) is
possible, but a request with `per_page=10&page=200` will return an error
(displaying vacancies from 2001 to 2010).

### Response

Successful server response is returned with `200 OK` code and contains the results in the same format 
as the [searching for jobs](vacancies.md#search-params):
