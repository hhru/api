## Processing model, terms and procedures

Responses and invitations correspond to the model displayed in API
requests and responses. If the application uses the model correctly, the change
of response and invitation business logics won't require their reprocessing or
corrections.

Responses and invitations contain following terms:

* *response* – object generated on the initiative of the applicant (response to the vacancy).
  Response is always sent with single CV on single vacancy.

* *invitation* – object generated on the initiative of the employer (vacancy
  invitation). Invitation is always sent for one vacancy for one CV.

Except of the object appearance process, the response and invitation processing is made
identically.

* <a name="term-collection"></a> *collection* – the set of responses/invitations,
  combined by certain criteria. Collections are used when your
  application needs **to display** the list of responses/invitations.
  The logic response/invitation processing is subject to change,
  so don't rely on having response/invitation in certain collection during processing.

* <a name="term-state"></a> *applicant status of response/invitation* –
  response/invitation status **displayed for the applicant**. Possible values
  are given in [`negotiations_state` reference guide](dictionaries.md#negotiations) and
  don't depend on vacancy in response/invitation.

* <a name="term-employer-state"></a> *employer status of response/invitation* –
  employer status of response/invitation. May differ from the
  applicant's. The list of possible statuses
  **depends on the vacancy and the employer**, so the list
  [should be requested](#states) upon transferring proper vacancy.

* <a name="term-action"></a> *respond/invitation action* – the action to be
  performed for response/invitation. As the result,
  the employer and the applicant statuses of response/invitation may be
  changed or leaved as is.

Don't confuse *action*, *collection* and *status* – they can look similar, but
designed for different purposes.


<a name="flow"></a>
## General description of processing responses/invitations

All actions on processing responses/invitations are made within
**one selected vacancy**. One employer can have vacancies
with different rules on processing responses/invitations.

First, you need to get the list
[of collections and employer statuses](#collections). Use collections
to **get the list of responses/invitations**. Ask user
to select the preferred collections. Retrive all
collection successively to receive all responses/invitations. List
of statuses should be used for reference only.

Request the vacancies related to selected CV to **create the invitation**
from the employer. See [employer vacancy list](employer_vacancies_for_invitation.md) for this data as well as required
parameters (key `arguments`) and status of generated
response (key `resulting_employer_state`). Different employers and vacancies
may employ different rules and statuses for added response. Each
pair *vacancy + CV* can have only one response/invitation.

To generate the invitation, the employer should have enabled access to
CV database. No access required to process the existing response/invitation. This
allows processing vacancy responses without access to CV database.

To **make an action** on response/invitation,
see [the list of actions](#actions-info) available in
[the list (collection) of responses/invitations](#negotiations-list) and in
[individual response/invitation](#get-negotiation). If this action results in
change of response/invitation status, it will be displayed in key
`resulting_employer_state`. Not all actions result in status change.

Invite the applicant to initiate
[free negotiation](#get-messages). You can
[send messages](#add-messages), and applicant can respond on them.
When necessary, the negotiation on certain vacancy may be
[disabled](employer_vacancies.md#allow_messages) (field `allow_messages`).

<a name="collections"></a>
## Collections and employer statuses for responses/invitations on vacancy

Employer has available collections of responses and invitations. The list of these collections
may be changed depending on the vacancy.

You can get available vacancies of the current user through
[employer vacancy list](employer_vacancies.md#active).

Presently, there is no collection combining all responses/invitations on the vacancy
available. Request all collections successively to get
the full list.

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | --------
found | number | Number of responses found ( ≥ 0 )

per_page | number | Number of elements per page ( > 0 )
page | number | Number of the current page ( ≥ 0 )

<a name="negotiations-list-item"></a>
The `items` entity contains response/invitation data and CVs for them:

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | --------
id | string | Response ID
created_at | string | Response/invitation creation date and time
updated_at| string | Response/invitation update date and time
state | object | Current [response status of the applicant](#term-state).
employer_state | object | Current [employer status of the applicant](#term-employer-state).
actions| list | list of possible [actions on response/invitation](#actions-info)
url | string | URL to get [the full version of response/invitation](#get-negotiation)
messages_url | string | URL to get [the list of messages in the response](#get-messages)
resume| object, null | [Short CV](resumes.md#resume-short). To get full CV, send a GET request to URL from key `url`. It can be `null`, if the applicant deleted the CV or disabled access to it.
has_updates| logical | Whether the response/invitation includes updates that require attention. The flag can be disabled upon different response/invitation actions, e.g. upon [viewing message list](#get-messages), and [appropriate view of CV on response/invitation](#view-resume).
viewed_by_opponent| logical | Whether the response was viewed by the applicant

<a name="view-resume"></a>

The list of responses/invitations contains only basic CV info.
To get full info, such as applicant contact details,
request the full CV. The applicant will see this CV request in
view history.

**Important!** Additional request on CV data **should be**
sent to URL from JSON response. This is the only option
to correctly process the request in view history. E.g, if the CV is requested from the response
to anonymous vacancy, the history will display anonymous name of the company.

If the vacancy of requested responses doesn't exist or
not available to the current user, `404 Not Found` response will be returned.

<a name="actions-info"></a>
### Response/invitation actions (`actions`)

The number of actions may differ, and the list of actions may be
empty.

Each action is indicated with:

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | --------
id | string | Action ID
name | string | Action name
enabled | logical | Whether the action is possible
method | string | HTTP method to perform
url | string | URL to send the request to
resulting_employer_state | object, null | [employer status](#term-employer-state) on response/invitation enabled upon the action. If the action doesn't change the status – `null`.
templates | list | Letter templates. Contains the template ID and url for [obtaining text according to the template](negotiation_message_templates.md).
arguments | list | Mandatory and optional arguments for the request

Action has attached list of possible arguments
such as:

* `message` – the message that will be sent to the applicant's email. Use [templates](negotiation_message_templates.md) to obtain texts.
* `address_id` – ID of the [address](employer_addresses.md) that will be specified in the invitation
* `send_sms` – whether to notify the applicant of the invitation via SMS. In order to send specify `true`, default value is `false`.

The application should be capable of entering these arguments. In future we may add other arguments, however
they won't be mandatory. Mandatory arguments may vary depending
on response/invitation.

Each argument will be indicated with:

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | --------
id | string | Argument ID
required | logical | Mandatory argument
required_arguments | list | Arguments to be applied if this argument is indicated. E.g., the address is optional, however if it is indicated you must also specify the message.
