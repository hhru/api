Assessment tools are tests and questionnaires designed to be taken by
applicants.

Information about them may be present in messages sent by an
[employer](employer_negotiations.md#get-messages) to an
[applicant](negotiations.md#get_messages) within the responses/invitations.


The object looks as follows:

```json
{
    "id": "123",
    "name": "Dynamic numerical ability test",
    "actions": [
        {
            "id": "proceed",
            "name": "Go to testing",
            "enabled": true,
            "alternate_url": "https://hh.ru/applicant/assessment/123"
        }
    ]
}
```
