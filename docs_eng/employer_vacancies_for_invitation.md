Returned is a list similar to
[published vacancies of the current manager](employer_vacancies.md#active)
with [standard fields](vacancies.md#nano), as well as additional fields:

 * `negotiations_state`-- response/invitation status for this vacancy or `null`
   if there was no response/invitation
 * `can_invite`-- The flag that determines whether it is possible to invite
   the specified CV to this vacancy
 * `employer_negotiations_state` - current employer status of
   the response/invitation or `null` if there was no response/invitation
 * `templates`-- list of [templates](negotiation_message_templates.md) with
   texts for invitation
 * <a name="actions"></a> `negotiations_actions`-- list of possible actions on
   response/invitation for [creating invitation](employer_negotiations.md#add-invite).
   Response format is similar to
   [the responses/invitations actions](employer_negotiations.md#actions-info).

When deciding whether to grant a user the possibility to invite a selected CV
for the vacancy, you should not rely on the fact that `negotiations_state` has
the `null` value and should use the `can_invite` flag.

Presence of the `can_invite` = `true` flag in the vacancy means the invitation
process will be successful. For example, in the meantime between obtaining a
list of suitable vacancies and invitation, an applicant may delete his/her CV.

In case the vacancy with specified CV already has a response/invitation, its
state will be specified as:

```json
{
    "negotiations_state": {
        "id": "response",
        "name": "Response"
    },
    "negotiations_employer_state": {
        "id": "response",
        "name": "Response"
     }
}
```

Possible values of the state/invitation for an applicant are available in the
[negotiations_state reference](dictionaries.md), for employer in the
[employer statuses for responses/invitations on vacancy](employer_negotiations.md#collection).


### Errors

When the request is made without any authorization or with the applicant
authorization, `403 Forbidden` code will be returned.

If the specified employer does not exist, or its vacancies are unavailable,
`404 Not Found` error will be returned.
